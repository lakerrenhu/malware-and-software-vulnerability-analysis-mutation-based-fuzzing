malware and software vulnerability analysis:  mutation-based fuzzing
Fuzzing:

The goal of this project is to implement a “fuzzer”, or fuzz tester. Fuzz testing is one way of discovering security vulnerabilities in any code that processes potentially malicious input.

A mutation-based fuzzer takes a valid input (such as the included cross.jpg file) for the target program, and works by creating random mutations/changes to generate new test cases. Mutation-based fuzzers are application independent, and so you do not need to have any knowledge about input format (i.e., jpeg format) accepted by the target program.
 
Implementation:
You need to code a mutation-based fuzzer to discover as many bugs (among those 8 manually inserted bugs) as you can.
